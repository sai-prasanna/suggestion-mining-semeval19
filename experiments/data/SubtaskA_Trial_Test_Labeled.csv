1313_2,"Many thanks Sameh Hi, As we know, there is a lot of limitations is WP8 OS due the high security in the OS itself which is very good, but some time we need to allow some apps to do extra works, apps which we trust i.e: hotmail app, facebook app, skype app ....",0

1316_1,Please add this simple and extremely helpful feature.,1
1318_2,Why not let us have several pages that we can put tiles on and name whatever we want to .,1
1319_1,The Idea is if user running our app and by any reason he rebooted the phone so in that case once reboot happen there should be some event so that we can detect that phone is rebooted and we can handle our application accordingly,1
1319_2,Add support for the biometric framework from windows 7/8 to allow hardware manufactures to add fingerprint sensors for device login (login allows standard user & guest/kid mode) and for wallet (WP8) transaction activation.,1
1319_6,"It would be more natural to allow the physical search key to activate the search function on the active application, rather than loading Bing which is rarely the goal.",1

1319_8,"On WP8 add optional support to hook these hardware keys press events for the lens (plug-in) features...hardware keys should include vol+, vol-, stage 1 (light press) camera shutter, stage 2 (deep press) camera shutter.",1

1330_14,This communication channel can use the Bing Translator to generate the statement in the languages in which the application has been translated.,1

1338_3,I keep getting birthday notifications a day too early.,0

1339_2,"With WP7 we have the unique ability to offer Trails for Paid Apps, which is great.",0
1342_1,"However, it would be nice if developers could offer Free Apps with a possibility to users for voluntary donations.",1
1342_2,"Some devs do the workaround and offer a Paid app, with the trial version having no restrictions at all (if the user clicks 'buy', he essentially donates to the dev).",0
1342_3,"However, this workaround has the disadvantage of the app not apprearing in the 'free' category, though they are actually free.",0
1343_1,"Therefore, it would be great if devs could put apps in the marketplace offering two buttons: 'install (free)' and 'install and donate (e.g.0,99$)'.",1
1343_3,"The price could be splitted 30-70 just like with paid apps, just with the difference of the app appearing in the 'free' category.",1
1344_2,The current process is very lengthy and costly for non US developers.,0
1344_3,Why can't Microsoft simplify it?,0
1345_1,Make it similar if not the same as Google!?!?!,1
1346_1,"Having read through the cumbersome process, I am more incline to build FREE apps with subscription rather than getting any money through the Marketplace.",0
1348_1,Having to deal with physical paperwork (sending it back and forth) is a step backwards... we are living in a digital world!,0
1348_2,"There are heaps and HEAPS of really good developers outside of US who really want to contribute to making Windows Phone a preferred choice, so please Microsoft; make it simplier and make it DIGITAL!",1
1348_4,"It would be really helpful if, for example, a developer makes an app that takes advantage of the schedule alarm API, and would like to enable the user to select a custom ringtone for that alarm.",1
1349_1,"This API proposal would enable the user to select from many ringtones already available on the phone, and save developers the trouble of having to implement their own custom ringtones.",0
1350_1,"If you try to copy-paste multiple recipient number to the ""To:"" box in the messaging, the 2nd until the last number will be duplicated.",0
1353_3,Even as a developer we can create most of the apps for individual users that is standalone.,0
1353_4,"If we need to target corporates then then we would need more APIs for device management, also like Zune (for a single user), we would need an Enterprise Server Application which can control the devices (of employees) remotely where we can apply corporate policies on the device as well.",1

1369_2,"Barring that, at least allow for merged listings for WP7 and WP8 versions so that customers have a clear upgrade path for the same application.",1

1383_1,Cant use keyboard in landscape mode in some app,0
1383_2,You would finally be able to add and customize your alert and text sounds!,0
1383_5,Of course each app would have permission accepted by user and each app would have own isolated storage for more private.,0
1383_6,It would be nice to see Windows Phone move to optional vector based icons instead of static bitmaps.,1
1383_7,This would allow the application bar (or appbar) to resize if say HD screens were added.,0
1383_8,"Ideally, users would only need 2 icons for the marketplace: 'Tile' (contains the application name), and 'List' (just the icon for the app list).",0
1383_9,Appbars could be created at 48x48 and resized as needed.,0
1383_10,"I know this is a pain on developers that are not designers or have designers, but an option would be nice time saver for the future.",1

1404_7,"Oh, and I want the option to create labels for the textbox.",0
1404_8,Provide the access to pictures in PhotoChooser and Camera Roll in emulator,1
1404_9,Since the easiest way to get hold of files to be used in programs is by downloading them from a network or the internet and saving them in isolated storage it would make the whole thing a lot easier if you could do this with FTP.,0
1404_10,FTP is still one of the most used protocols for retrieving files.,0
1404_11,And using a proxy is not always an options since some of us would like to be able to reach FTP servers that is on a separate network.,0

1407_4,"Continuing my prior post about allowing us to explicitly flip secondary live tiles with a tap instead of launching the app, this request would allow such an action to explicitly update the tile by triggering a function call in a background task.",1
1408_1,"Perhaps these two ideas are combined and you define which action to take when creating/updating the tile... Flip the tile, execute a background task (or both), or simply launch the app like normal (possibly with deep toast.)",1
1408_2,"That would really make LiveTiles 'Live' which now, they kind of aren't and were by *far* the biggest disappointment when we saw the actual SDK.",0
1409_1,"Coming from iOS, when we did see that, we scrapped two apps we were going to release on WP7.",0
1409_2,"(A third was scrapped because of the inability to do location tracking in a background task more frequently than once every 30 minutes, which is sort of the same 'stale data' issue as here.)",0

1421_1,For sharing audio and video there should be a very plain possibility to share stuff as already encoded package.,1
1421_3,Perhaps that could be available as Toolkit in codeplex.com.,1
1422_1,There needs to be an Alpha Test mechanism available.,1
1424_1,"Since the beta test versions I recently submitted have been waiting for certification for 9 days, there is no way for us to work together on this.",0
1424_2,My boss is not a developer and has no development tools but absolutely needs to see the progress of development in a timely manner.,0
1425_1,If the Beta program certified apps in a day then this might not be a problem.,0

1435_4,Users receive a strange marketplace error when trying to download the application.,0
1437_1,When developing apps it is often useful to leverage existing Launchers and Choosers as Tasks to access certain data or perform an operation.,0
1437_2,Currently this is only exposed for system-level data and operations.,0
1438_1,It would be ideal to allow apps to expose certain bits of data or functionality to other apps to provide a complementary experience in terms of reuse of information or performing similar tasks.,1
1438_2,Imagine shopping apps being able to share a set of data such as a wish list or news apps being able to share a list of news feeds.,0
1440_1,"Imagine having an installed app do what it does best for another app, such as perform a series of complex calculations or gather weather data.",0
1440_2,It would be the responsibility of the app to decide what it exposes for data or functionality.,0
1440_4,This can first be alleviated as with other security screening by prompting the user to allow an app to access another app's tasking features.,1

1464_3,You can sometimes work around this behaviour by specifying a search for the place you're trying to indicate but this is dependent upon the search results.,0
1465_1,If the search finds nothing you get no pin.,0
1465_2,Or if the search finds something other than what you intended you can end up with a pin (or pins) far from where you want them.,0
1466_3,If it were possible to tell the task to show a pin (or pins) at a specific point (or points) that that would allow for a better user experience.,1
1467_1,Even if we could just specify a label for the pin that would be better than nothing.,1
