251,Use the Supermarche across the street for snacks and sodas.,1
252,"Also, they are renovating the metro stop closest to the Eiffel until next March, so walking is a nicer option.",1
253,"If you are staying in this hotel, DO NOT stay in section C facing the back of the hotel!!!",1
254,"For a cheaper breakfast, right on the corner of Sutter street there is a diner where classic American breakfast is served.",1
255,I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that was traveling to san francisco (and especially if they're looking to shop!).,1
256,"So, don't just look at the ranking, make sure you are staying at a MOTEL, NOT a hotel.",1
257,One tip though.... it can be better to go the end of the line/terminus to get a car and join the queue as some are very busy,1
258,One suggestion to the hotel - Sounds like being turned away for not having a room available has happened frequently in the past.,1
259,This is not the place to stay if you are on a romatice getaway.,1
260,and you can get up early and walk all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge.,1
261,Don't make the same mistake I did.,1
262,There is an abundance of restaurants/cafes/shops etc. Definately try the fresh crab from anywhere on Fishermans Grotto and the fresh clam chowder in a bread bowl from the boudin bakery.,1
263,Do a wine country tour it is good to get out of SF and have a few!,1
264,Don't miss the complimentary wine tasting at 5pm every day - great way to meet other travellers and enjoy a glass or two.,1
265,"If you want to see the Golden Gate Bridge, you can rent bikes or two seater and four seater motorized vehicles from a few places within two or three blocks of the hotel.",1
266,We also recommend Polker's for breakfast.,1
267,"Nice bar two blocks east, great breakfast one block west on Van Ness where you pay for a great egg/bacon sandwhich.",1
268,"If you have a car, you can park here, which is a real bonus in a city where parking is limited.",1
269,If I was to give a couple of tips for staying in San Francisco they would be avoid Fishermans wharf unless you like really touristy trash,1
270,What a great city --wear comfortable shoes!!!,1
271,Overall I would not recommend.,1
272,"If you don't read up on it ahead of time, there is a channel on the tv with info about the hotel.",1
273,If you want to impress your cab driver - go with the St.,1
274,If you need to be directly across the street from Union Square and can't walk even one block (and why you would go to SF if that were the case) - go with the St.,1
275,"If you are willing to take the risk and leave your car with this hotel, be prepared to wait 15 minutes for them to retrieve the car.",1
276,Don't bother paying for brekkie unless you really want to pig out at the buffet.,1
277,They need to watch those food temperatures,1
278,I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.,1
279,"So if you have expectations of having a spa in the winter at this Marriott, forget it!",1
280,I'd probably start booking for a hotel much earlier and chosen a different hotel.,1
281,Overall I recommend this hotel.,1
282,"There's a little store in front of the hotel where you can get some goodies and snacks and bring them back to your hotel and use the mini fridge to store soda, water, etc. and should help save money from having to use the mini-bar stuff.",1
283,"Food prices at the hotel restaurant can be steep (but so are most restaurants at any hotel for that matter)Tips: Eat breakfast at a deli nearby the hotel, cheaper!",1
284,"Also, take a trip to Manly Beach if you have time,",1
285,An early arrival is always fraught with problems (one has little choice about when to arrive due to airline schedules).,1
286,"If you don't mind climbing up a small slope, try the Shangri-La.",1
287,As an insider tip ... walk all the way across the bridge and then underneath for great photo ops of the city ...,1
288,"Also had room service- quick and again, reasonable.",1
289,You shouldn't be in Sydney to sit in your room and watch TV.,1
290,"and for that the hotel scores great marks, however when staying in a hotel I would expect to be pampered or at the very least not longing to return to my own bed.",1
291,"Make sure you are aware of this, and plan your last day accordingly.",1
292,Whatever you do don't book the rooms with 2 single beds if you are an adult!,1
293,Take a 10 dollar taxi ride to the Sydney Harbour area or to downtown and you will get your fill of restaurants.,1
294,However if you get the price right and want clean,1
295,I would recommend the Altamont to the independent traveller.,1
296,My one suggestion for improvement would be that breakfast could be more imaginative and varied.,1
297,A hotel that wants to atrract a fashionable young crowd must surely think that a full length mirror in all bedrooms is a must.,1
298,You'd be better off going out on the town and finding breakfast at a cafe or restaurant.,1
299,I would recommend staying on the Club Floors if you choose this hotel.,1
300,I would stay there again but would make sure I was on the top floor.,1
301,"and staff quality I would advise you to go to one of the better know chain hotels, at least you know what to expect.",1
302,Other things to know: the large revolving front door is locked after midnight at some point - you need to press the green lighted button on the bellstand which then rings the night manager inside to let you in;,1
303,concierge desk has plenty of umbrellas at their desk if you need to borrow one; lighting inside the rooms seemed a bit sparse if you like it bright;,1
304,Certainly avoid the rooms at the back if you can,1
305,We highly recommend the Estherea.,1
306,"However, watch out for the bedbugs.",1
307,If you are thinking of visiting Amsterdam please do not look anywhere else!,1
308,(there's a very nice cafe next door with a huge breakfast for less than half that.,1
309," I suppose what you are paying for is the Hotel's Dam Square location, but considering how easy it is to get around in Amsterdam, and considering how noisy and dirty the Dam is, why not stay some place a little further away and just walk over?",1
310,"Also, if you arrive in Amsterdam by car, be prepared to spend an arm",1
311,The lobby could use a little work as well.,1
312,There are plenty of restaurants nearby including the Hard Rock Cafe just across the canal.,1
313,and if you get lost around Amsterdam at least you only have to follow the signs back to Central station!!,1
314,I can recommend the cocktails in the front bar.,1
315,"Plus there are many better things to spend your money on in Amsterdam, enjoy!",1
316,"Would recommend the ice bar too to any future visitors, tho it was smaller than we thought,",1
317,Please be aware though there was no indication that breakfast was not included,1
318,The great thing about this hotel is it is directly opposite Central station which is a huge plus point if you are passing through with heavy bags or are coming from the Airport.,1
319,so if you are taking a car expect to pay in the region of 40 Euros for 24hr parking.,1
320,Would recommend this hotel although for its location.,1
321,The usual taxi service from the hotel to the airport was 48E so if your trying to budget it might be better to take the tram/train route.,1
322,"If you have a 5 star reservation in any hotel in amsterdam, cancel it!",1
323,"If you have traveled Europe, you know baths are not large.",1
324,Get off after the floating flower market (fourth stop from central station.,1
325,I always think you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover though.,1
326,Please be advised that there are steep stairs leading in to this hotel so it would not be suitable for anyone with walking difficulties,1
327,"Breakfast not overly exciting, but there is a great pancake shop below the hotel which I would recommend.",1
328,"If you don't have alot of stamina, skip this place.",1
329,Get your strip of tram tickets at a newsagent as pricey on the trams themselves.,1
330,(You have an hour to get back on any tram if you want to use the same just-stamped ticket.).,1
331,The Anne Frank House is round the corner (go late to avoid queues),1
332,Would highly recommend Hotel Nadia and would definately stay again if visiting Amsterdam in the future.,1
333,Though you can always sleep with earplugs.,1
334,"you just want a base from which to explore this beautiful city,",1
335,There is a train from central station that will take you straight to the airport for a few euro.,1
336,And expect to hear noises from most of the rooms - unless you specifically ask for a quiet one!,1
337,"Would not recommend this hotel, definately not worth the money, avoidlike the plague.",1
338,just don't expect any views out the window.,1
339,"We would highly recommend the hotel and its hosts for any travelers,",1
340,The tram will deposit you within one block of the hotel (at the stop just opposite the Van Gogh museum).,1
341,"The bathroom was large, with a shower and bathtub (and rubber duck!) You can buy tickets to the Rembrandt Museum and Rijksmuseum through the hotel.",1
342,"If you choose a smaller room, Hans will store your luggage.",1
343,A chair would be useful for longer than one night stays.,1
344,You have got to try this place when in Amsterdam!,1
345,you can catch a tram from outside the hotel to all areas.,1
346,They should simply put whirlpool jets in it and accept the fact that it is nothing more than a big bathtub.,1
347,"I would recommend Costa Gallega, one block north on the Passeig de Gracia (get the piquillo peppers stuffed with crabmeat, patatas bravas, and wash down with a good cold glass of the local Penedes wine - Vina Sol.",1
348,Mattress in need of replacement or rotation - I felt I would slide off the bed because the mattress leaned towards the telephone.,1
349,"Suggestion: If you insist on staying, view your room beforehand!!",1
350,I am avoiding all Ritz Carltons for the next century and suggest you stay away from this monstrosity in Barcelona.,1
351,"One block walk takes you to the Metro, and from there, you are minutes away from everything,",1
352,Remember to take ID if you go to the casino next doorIts a real shame that we had the problems that we did otherwise probably couldn't fault the hotel,1
353,"I wouldn't normally write reviews, however after having such a stay at the weekend I feel compelled to recommend to others not to waste their money and stay at this hotel.",1
354,stay somewhere else in barcelona ... and go to the Arts to visit the great bar and the fantastic Arola restaurant,1
355,This hotel has a great location if you want to do the whole tourist thing around the Ramblas.,1
356,There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which should really be standard in a 4 Star hotel.,1
357,"If you are still tempted to visit, stay in a hotel off the Las Ramblas as I think you will get a much better deal.",1
358,"It's a great place for young, old, single and couples, however put on your streetwise hat, because there are hustlers working the Ramblas",1
359,"the breakfast doesn't really rise above standard Eurofare, though if you just need some fuel for the day ahead it'll do.",1
360,Do not hesitate in making a reservation at this place...,1
361,A 5/10 minute walk from the terminal along a signposted route brings you to the train station where a journey of 20 mins costing EUR2.,1
362,"Over, I would recommend this as a place to stay if visiting this great city.",1
363,Be sure to LOCK UP your stuff!!!,1
364,and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.,1
365,"But for a 5-star luxury hotel, it would be nice if they would drop off a bottle of water every day.",1
366,"I would consider staying here again, and would recommend it if you don't mind the location, but would probably stay closer to all the action next time.",1
367,"I suggest you try this place for yourself,",1
368,"If you are not Spanish, then don't even think about staying here (unless you enjoy feeling like an unwelcome guest).",1
369,There is a lot to see so get a cheap guide book and plan your visit.,1
370,"If I could give you one piece of advice -- either pay more for a hotel closer to where you will actually be doing things, or come back at another time.",1
371,"If you want to get around the sights, use the bus touristico it's great.",1
372,and we highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city.,1
373,In other words make sure you ck your bill before leaving the hotel.,1
374,"and if you have a skateboarder in the party (as we did) it is very convenient for several of the better spots (MACBA, Universitat, one stop on metro to Paral.",1

381,"If you're a VERY light sleeper, go for internal room.",1
382,"Antoni, a wonderful place to spend an hour (or more) if you are at all interested in local food, culture, language, etc. The metro is a block away, cabs are available on call or on the street (within a minute or two, but spotty).",1
383,"Avoid the SPA area which is a joke,",1
384,"nice hotel, but don't stay here unless you don't care not to receive your faxes in time, or if telephones are transfered to the wrong room (if you are the unlucky one to have the same family name as another guest...) better stay at the Plaza Athenee or Meurice!",1
385,"Try the ice-bar if you are visiting,",1
386,"Make sure you re-finance your home, sell your car and bring lots of cash for the many employees who are grateful for their $20 tips all day.",1

388,You could have got here by a combination of the Roissy bus and Metro 8,1

390,Don't expect to go to sleep any time prior to 2am because the radiator pipes will keep you awake.,1

392,"Think hard before booking this hotel - the room rate might seem ok,",1
393,"I would love to go back and would definitely recommend it for the ambience, fantastic location, totally amazing staff and all the special treats!",1

395,Grab a couple bakery items at one of the corner bakeries and have a seat at the counter of the Cafe Bleu for a morning cafe au lait.,1
396,"though, we do recommend this hotel to others.",1
397,"There is a Boulanger a few doors up if you decided to buy croissants, baguettes, eclairs etc and the metro is literally right outside.",1
398,"However, DO NOT accept rooms 701 or 702 if you are a light sleeper (like me.) The rooms are on the ground floor, off the courtyard.",1
399,We left half the box on the table,1
400,"My advice is book a hotel in an area with more charm, unless you want to be downtown,",1
401,room needs better electricity plugs,1
402,"A tip - if you want a really quiet room, ask for one at the back of the hotel above floor 10. We took breakfast every morning in the hotel's restaurant, Luques.",1
403,"If you are sharing a room with someone you do not know, get TWO rooms.",1
404,Ask for a room in the back of the hotel or high up.,1
405,My daughter and I just returned from a four night stay at the Pulitzer and were very disappointed.,0
406,I had searched for a good hotel at a rate of up to $300 a day and after much research decided on the Pulitzer.,0
407,Big mistake.,0
408,We saw a lot of tour groups in the hotel,0
409,"In summary, I would not spend the money to stay at the Sheraton Pulitzer, and would hope that this is not typical of Starwood luxury properties.",0
410,I mainly chose the property for it's location (I used to live in the neighborhood and absolutely love the area).,0
411,How odd is it to get the same room twice?,0
412,"Well I did, and since staying in it 3 years ago,",0
413,"In addition to their attitude, cobwebs and dust were prevalent",0
414,and the only thing that changed from day to day was a made bed.,0
415,3 Positive Aspects:1. The location.,0
416,and the canal location is exquisite.,0
417,Staying in a canal house is an experience and makes the hotel very unique and Dutch.,0
418,I guess I just don't have the proper appreciation for the difficulty in joining 20 odd canal houses together to make a hotel.,0
419,Or maybe it was just my expectations of what I would find in the way of a five star property.,0
420,"But in any event, I was underwhelmed with the Pulitzer.",0
421,"In fact, there are many apartments that are considerably smaller (okay, so I peeked in the windows of way too many apartments as I walked along the canals).",0
422,No central lobby to speak of.,0
423,I mean awful.,0
424,this hotel is truely the best in amsterdam and an enjoyable place to stay.,0
425,our 3 pound little dog just loved it and felt like home immediately.,0
426,i honestly cant find anything bad to say about the pulitzer and staff given the price/reward ratio.,0
427,In fact by looking @ price/reward i find the Pulitzer to be in the highest category of 5 star hotels ive been to...,0
428,Location just cant be beat....,0
429,This place is killer and happy to return shortly...,0
430,Just spent 3 nights at this hotel 5th March 04 -8th March 04. The location is excellent,0
431,my husband and I were on the third floor the people staying above on the 4th could have been in the room with us.,0

433,Confirmed in email by the hotel for this advance request.,0
434,"Yet, arrived on date planned.",0
435,"we got one that was smelling very heavily the cigar (so an other 20mn to change and get an other room)3) they were sorry for this,",0
436,"I said that i was not willing to pay,",0
437,"This was the first day, nice....unfortunatly we pre-paid the 3 nights (325 euros per night...not cheap for Amsterdam),",0

440,"Everybody now that i meet, i tell them to NEVER go to this hotel.",0
441,Got a great rate for this hotel on hotwire ($195 per night) so was really pleased to be staying here.,0
442,I had some reservations about booking with the Pulitzer after reading the mixed reviews but was talked into it by my travel agent who books high end travel.,0
443,We were woken up by a mouse scratching at the door trying to get out of our room.,0
444,but I can see where it gets spotty reviews.,0
445,The hard part is that is a far better hotel than most amsterdam hotels so.....,0
446,and with that range of experiences here is what to expectGood:Location and concept (row houses around two canals)Beds,0
447,and I got food poisoning onceService attitude,0
448,and the Amstel is very good but very old fashioned,0
449,We had made reservations for this hotel,0
450,"I planned a trip with my parents who are 70yo,",0
451,and I wanted to treat them with a nice experience in one of the best hotel in Amsetrdam.,0
452,Orrible experience!,0
453,My parents were shocked!,0
454,"the concierge could not find me tickets for any concert in town,",0
455,the staff is tired and not helpfull.,0
456,"The Hotel's location is brilliant, and within walking distance of the rest of the city.",0
457,"The Moroccan door and bar staff likewise were helpful, polite and efficient.",0
458,"and management were lazy, rude, complacent and could not manage anything without conflict including the printing a bill when checking out.",0
459,"After refusing them a carte blanche on my credit card they remarkably had a working computer and printer, after claiming billing problems.",0
460,They then tried to pull the same trick on Asian members of my traveling party.,0
461,"When I left, the lobby resembled the port at Rotterdam all morning because someone could not organize somewhere else (e.g. an empty conference room?) to put the luggage of a German coach holiday.",0
462,"Given the attitude of the senior staff, I think they may be getting more English stag parties and elderly coach tourists than those the Starwood group desire.",0
463,I stayed at the Hotel Pulitzer in the beginning of January.,0
464,Stayed at the Pulitzer for business at the beginning of June 2005.,0
465,Breakfast for Euro 20 was OK!,0
466,The location is great!,0
467,It was my 5th visit in Amsterdam but my frist stay at the Pulitzer.,0

471,"We used the room service for dinner the first night because we arrived late,",0
472,"Having booked a deluxe room at the Pulitzer, we were very much looking forward to our one night stay.",0
473,"and more tatty the further we went,",0
474,our expectations were disappointed.,0
475,"Finally, having lugged our suitcases up a winding and dirty staircase we got to our room.",0
476,We were extremely unimpressed by the quality of service we encountered.,0
477,The high price we paid to stay here does not represent value for money as far as we are concerned,0
478,Stayed there on New Year's Eve in a reward room so it was free.,0
479,Rooms facing the canal may get much better view.,0
480,The hotel itself lies along a grand canal in a beautiful and historic Amsterdam neighborhood.,0
481,My husband and I went for a romantic weekend and are already getting ready to book again for the holiday season!,0
482,I have stayed here twice recently and have to say I am extremely disappointed in it.,0
483,I stayed during the week on a business trip.,0
484,"Also, simple requests are never followed through",0
485,and this includes my wake up call which didn't happen and asking for an iron which never arrived.,0
486,I really can't see how it gets away with claiming to be in any way a 'luxury hotel.,0
487,It's a row of houses converted into a hotel which is run in a poor to decidedly average manner.,0
488,"Stayed here for 3 nights in May 08, in an executive canal room.",0
489,"Good stuffThe location is the best in Amsterdam, away from the noise and sometimes seedy side of Amsterdam.",0
490,and the houses with big tall windows and was light,0
491,Staff were friendly and most were helpful Great restaurants,0
492,and we were shocked!,0
493,As the hotel was full then no upgrades were availableDue to the lack of soundproofing noise travels,0
494,and we had noisy neighbours next door,0
495,Our trip was a special occasion,0
496,and we had booked champagne,0
497,but for the difference in price I had assumed it would be!,0
498,and sunday morning - monday was much better for service as a whole,0
499,and I guess that during the week is much better and quietier.,0
500,We left it too late,0
501,and paid too much for what we got.,0
502,We were planning to stay at this hotel,0
503,"Every other hotel in the Netherlands agreed to refund our money, but not this one.",0
504,"In fact, they were very rude",0
505,"In fact, when we talked with Starwood about this policy, they actually told us that it was up to the local manager to make the determination.",0
506,I stayed at the hotel during my first trip to Amsterdam.,0
507,As a SPG I was updated to a wonderful room at the end of the hallway.,0
508,ALthough it wasn't a huge room by any means it was big enough for me.,0
509,the up and downs it takes to get to one's room gets old.,0
510,"The front desk girl, Alexis, was not too friendly and rather negative.",0
511,"So I moved to the Amstel Hotel, a true 5 star!",0
512,It was not until months later that the credit card company resolved the matter in our favor.,0
513,I am shocked at the way this matter was mishandled by the hotel.,0
514,I am shocked by the other reviews.,0
515,I travel for business on a daily basis,0
516,I was shocked needless to say that they basically accused the front desk of stealing...,0
517,I make the next biggest mistake of going to eat at the resturant.. and eating...,0
518,I got violently ill...,0
519,I spent the next day in bed...,0
520,I return to the Bar the next night after recovering..,0
521,and the bar tender asks me how my night was ...,0
522,I mention how ill I got,0
523,and he asked what I ate I mentioned it an he shook his head and bought me a shot...,0
524,I called down on the 4th day and said I have not been able to stay connected for more that 5 minutes...,0
525,and ---I was told would you like me to give you the number again....,0
526,I know I was rude with the last comment.,0
527,I wish I experienced the service that the previous guests experienced.,0
528,Stayed here recently for 3 nights.,0
529,I am a Starwood Platinum member,0
530,and checked in assuming I would be given my upgrade to the best available room (this wording according to policies by Starwood).,0
531,But i called the duty manager the next night and asked for a larger room.,0
532,At first he fed me some story about small rooms.,0
533,"They tried to just give me an upgrade to the next class of room, not the best class.",0
534,Other things to note: PROS: 2 free stroopfwaffles each day; GREAT BEDS!,0
535,but given what we paid we expected more.,0
536,"Overall, for what they charged I was expecting more.",0
537,"After much research, I finally decided on this hotel because of its position in Amsterdam and being classed asluxury seemed an ideal choice for my daughter and I to spend a weekend as her special birthday treat.",0
538,"At Reception the Night-Duty Manager(female) whose name I have noted, appeared to resent being interrupted whilst in conversation with a friend, her expression when I told her what we thought was the cause; practically a sneer of disbelief.",0
539,"At no point did she seem interested,I could feel my professional face about to develop.",0
540,"Because I did not wish to spoil my daughter's first visit, I did not pursue the matter as vociferously as I would normally, or when with my husband.",0
541,"In conclusion, a disappointing choice when one compares this hotel with others experienced, of a supposed lesser category.",0
542,My family and I had a nice and trouble free 4 night stay at the Pulitzer.,0
543,"Family-Friendly As a couple with a young child (toddler) in tow, we appreciated the ample and uncrowded public spaces more than the room itself.",0
544,"Between the points and a corporate rate, we were only supposed to pay about 800 Euros for a 5 night stay, which seemed very reasonable.",0
545,"When we arrived, we received the same treatment at the front desk as many previous reviewers...",0
546,and they were generally disorganized and not very cordial (though not rude).,0
547,The furniture was nice but shabby - scratched and dented.,0
548,"Being on the canal had its perks, but we could hear people walking by (talking, shouting and laughing) until the wee hours.",0
549,We heard banging during the day.,0
550,"and while the breakfast was great, I wouldn't spend the extra 75 Euros a night to include it in the price of my room (seemingly the only differentiator between a regular room and executive).",0
551,"We did spend 38 Euros pp to take a 1.5 hour ride on their lovely canal boat, which would have been great if not for a family with a baby who showed up late with a stroller and displaced other passengers.",0
552,"We booked a three-night stay using Starpoints, arriving December 30, 2008.",0
553,"I am a Starwood Platinum,",0
554,and I was informed that no upgrades were available because the hotel was sold out for new years eve.,0
555,"Later that evening, I checked the hotel's website and saw that the hotel was not sold out.",0
556,"We could hear noises in the hallway, from the room above us, and from the heater.",0
557,We stayed at the Pulitzer some time ago (August of 2007) so some memories are lost.,0
558,"We had a friend that stayed in a neighborhood closer to the red light district, and let me say...",0
559,we spent a lot more time in our neighborhood.,0
560,They have their own canal boat for tours,0
561,"but that is the norm for Amsterdam apparently (when our friend came over he said his room was ""pretty much the size of our bathroom...no, seriously!""",0
562,"We were on the first floor on the canal, but was a bit noisy from road noise and some construction work being done.",0
563,"Non-existent service, poor food, rude attitude, overwhelmed staff, noisy, stuffy rooms.",0
564,My problems began when i arrived early for check in- 10am.,0
565,As you can imagine i refused- not a good way to start your holiday.,0
566,Views looked out to another building almost immediatly opposite,0
567,and the lack of light was depressing (no ceiling light).,0
568,"To all their fairness they refunded back 1/3 of my fee, that still leaves 200 euros for the night which is still a ludicrous price for that hotel- My advise?",0
569,I just read some of the bad reviews for the Pulitzer,0
570,and I couoldn't agree more.,0
571,Last year the hotel was still getting raves,0
572,and it's about time that the reviews reflect how bad the place really is.,0
573,but at least we faced the courtyard instread of being in the attic.,0
574,The concierge consistantly gave bad advice if he gave any at all.,0
575,we were very excited to see that.,0
576,I stayed at the Westin Grand this past weekend during my trip to Berlin to run the marathon.,0
577,As a family member of a Starwood Hotels employee I have stayed at many Westin properties,0
578,and this one was about in the middle in terms of quality.,0
579,"On the plus side, the location was great.",0
580,"It is close to public transportation, close to many of the city attractions and close to the start of the marathon.",0
581,It also was great to have access to the spa and pool before and after the race.,0
582,I also agree with many posters that the breakfast was great.,0
583,They also did not charge me for my 7 year old son,0
584,and he eats quite a bit.,0
585,"On the negative side, was the fact they did not change towels on one day",0
586,and only stocked the bathroom supplies once for a 3 night stay.,0
587,"Additionally, room service for a pot of coffee took 1 hour.",0
588,I stayed in an unrenovated room with a view out the window onto Fredrichstrasse.,0
589,This was nice since I could see a portion of the race route and could watch roller bladers,0
590,and runners go by from my window.,0
591,Overall the stay was just above neutral.,0
592,I stayed at the Westin Berlin 3 or 4 times.,0
593,This time I stayed for two nights,0
594,and they gave me a room upgrade to a renovated room.,0
595,Renovated?,0
596,"Yes, they call it renovated.",0
597,The renovated rooms are located to the courtyard and have the same size like the normal rooms.,0
598,"Bad smell, ugly furniture, bad design, old fahioned, dirty, noisy a/c and not really a heavenly bed I guess.",0
599,"Still, the location is the best",0
600,and the lobby is very pritty and impressive.,0
601,"But the rest of the hotel, forget about it.",0
602,Also the food at Friedrichs is boring and very traditional.,0
603,My wife and I stayed two nights at this hotel at the end of February.,0
604,"The carnival was in full swinging in Berlin, but not in this hotel.",0
605,"Granted, as you enter the lobby you feel that you are entering into a great hotel.",0
606,"The lobby is beautiful and has a luxurious feel, with a loveably staircase,",0
607,but the luxury ends right there.,0
608,"The schizophrenic state starts as you begin walking to your room, what an awful smell in the corridor.",0
609,I concur with previous reviews;,0
610,I felt I was walking through a sewer.,0
611,Then you enter the room.,0
612,"A twin bedded room, and I mean twin and small beds.",0
613,Really separate beds.,0
614,"Request for change was denied, notwithstanding my Starwood card.",0
615,No heavenly pillows; no heavenly beds; and no heavenly comforters here.,0
616,I felt I was staying at a **star hotel room.,0
617,Then you enter the bathroom.,0
618,It must have been decorated by the owner of a hospital.,0
619,"It was all white, with no goodies.",0
620,"I accept, however, that we had a balcony and a great view unto the Unter den Linden, but that was it.",0
621,"In conclusion, this is no *****star hotel.",0
622,I stayed at the Grand Westin several times.,0
623,Lobby and location is perfect.,0
624,Service is so so.,0
625,I'm a Starwood Platinum Member and they didn't upgrade me!,0
626,They said it was a congress like Berlinale or so.,0
627,"The rooms are so old fashioned, stinky and noisy.",0
628,Bathrooms are even worse.,0
629,"In reality, rooms look different!",0
630,(and much worse!!),0
631,"The best thing about the Westin, as everybody has already stated, is the location.",0
632,"But, this is not the only hotel in the area - The Hilton is just a few blocks away as are a few others that are in the 5 star range.",0
633,The big problem for me was the fact that the rooms have an ever present sewer smell that hits you as soon as you walk in the room.,0
634,"I was prepared for this as many of the reviewers have mentioned it, but still, it is unacceptable.",0
635,"I was staying here with my Starwood Points,",0
636,"so the room and breakfast were included in the award,",0
637,but my points are valuable,0
638,and I felt like I wasted them on this hotel.,0
639,"A curious thing for me was, when I walked outside the hotel, every so often, from Friedrichstrasse to the Brandenburg Gate,",0
640,that same awful smell would drift by.,0
641,We had a small trip to Berlin this spring and choosed this hotel because it is easy to reach and in the heart of berlin.,0
642,"Breakfast is one of the best I ever had,",0
643,but you have to wait quite a long time to get seated in this small and crowded breakfast room.,0
644,"As this is a quite large luxury hotel, the rooms are really small.",0
645,"The room we got was nothing special, small, clean, thats it.",0
646,"Overall the hotel is quite ok,",0
647,but I had better ones.,0
648,Just returned from a Great 3 night stay at the Westin on a fantastic priceline deal.,0
649,I would agree with earlier reviews that this hotel doesn't quite make the 5 star status it claims but is a very good 4 star property.,0
650,The hotel is located in the former East Berlin and is well placed for most of the sights.,0
651,Getting around is easy thanks to the U-Bahn station practically on the doorstep.,0
652,"The public areas are very grand especially the lobby with its huge atrium, sweeping staircase and piano player.",0
653,Couldn't notice any strange smells in the lifts as mentioned by a previous poster.,0
654,Bedroom was standard size and decorated in classic style.,0
655,The room did show some signs of wear (nothing major though),0
656,but a refurbishment programme is in progress (we had a note apologising for any noise heard though we did not hear any).,0
657,The beds were as promised Heavenly with a pillow that could be moulded to suit any height preference.,0
658,The bathroom whilst adequate was a rather basic white tiled room which didn't quite match the granduer of the bedroom and public areas.,0
659,Everything worked well though,0
660,and there was a good selection of bathroom products.,0
661,Staff were at all times exceptionally courteous and polite.,0
662,Breakfast was not included,0
663,My husband and I stayed at the Westin for three nights.,0
664,We had booked a non-smoking room but were given a smoking room instead.,0
665,"Our room was down a long corridor with three dead lightbulbs, which we pointed out but were not replaced during our stay.",0
666,As soon as I arrived I went to wash my hands,0
667,and I the head of the tap came off.,0
668,The fridge door became unhinged as soon as I opened it.,0
669,"This would have been funny were it not because we were on a rare break and, in addition, the room was tired, smelly, had a stained carpet and a stained armchair.",0
670,The net curtains had not seen a washer in a long while.,0
671,The sheets were not changed for three days,0
672,and one the them had a suspicious rosy mark on it.,0
673,"However, the worst thing was the level of service (or rather the complete lack of it).",0
674,We were not given another room and had to wait until the next day for the tap and fridge to be fixed.,0
675,I asked for the sheets to be changed three times,0
676,"and I was told they would be,",0
677,but it never happened.,0
678,Reception staff were plain rude,0
679,"and even the manager told me (I still can't believe I heard this) that they had given us a smoking room,",0
680,even if I had asked for a NS one because I happen to be Spanish,0
681,and most Spanish people smoke!,0
682,We tried the pool to relax ouserselves,0
683,but after waiting for 15 mins to get some towels we gave up (a single lady was managing the beauty centre and the whole pool area).,0
684,"The following day we were lucky with the towels, but found the poolside furniture dirty,",0
685,We were never given any apologies or signs of regret for the shortcomings we had to deal with.,0
686,A frustrating and depressing experience.,0
687,I had to pinch myself to believe it was actually happening.,0
688,I stayed at the Westin in mid september after having stayed there in 2005.,0
689,I have always like the location and was very impressed with the recent improvements.,0
690,The room was great with a modern updated decor.,0
691,"Most importantly, the staff were very helpful and friendly.",0
692,This had not been the case in 2005 when folks seemed cold...,0
693,"Let's have a round of applause, please, for the Westin Grand, for taking discount bookings to a new low.",0
694,"I have long suspected that hotels reserve the smallest room, the one with the worst view, or the one by the elevator, for guests who pay a discounted rate ...",0
695,"but never before have I been offered a dirty, smelly room and then upcharged for a ""renovated"" (i.e. clean) room.",0
696,"you come to the end of a regular-looking hotel corridor, pass through a lounge, and into a narrow, dark and musty corridor with doorways just about your height and barely wide enough to fit your carry-on luggage ... well,",0
697,you have been given a discount special!,0
698,"Turn around immediately and return to the front desk, where you will be charged an extra 30 Euros per night for a ""renovated"" room that, upon inspection, hasn't been renovated anytime in recent memory, but is at least cleaner and does not smell.",0
699,"Our first room was very small, the upholstery and lampshades(!) were stained, the furniture desperately needed to be refinished,",0
700,"and it had a very strong, musty odour (mould perhaps?) At the front desk we were told that because they were fully booked, they could only offer us another room in the same grade, or a ""renovated"" room for an extra 30 Euros per night.",0
701,(Fully booked?,0
702,But they could still find a better room for an additional fee?,0
703,"I'm not sure that I follow that logic, but whatever.) After our overseas flight we really didn't feel like arguing, so we just paid the extra - no way to say now if the other room in the same grade would have been acceptable.",0
704,"The second room, pictured here, was much better.",0
705,"It was larger, cleaner and updated (though the washroom was clearly not renovated, as I've noted in my pictures).",0
706,"I would have been perfectly happy if we had been offered this to begin with, and would have given the hotel a higher rating,",0
707,but I consider our treatment unacceptable.,0
708,"Having said that, I still ranked this hotel a 2 rather than a 1 because the breakfast buffet was fantastic, and the location was very convenient for sightseeing.",0
709,"The room service was also quite good, and the staff friendly and (for the most part) helpful.",0
710,I haven't stayed at too many nicer hotels.,0
711,Nor would I generally spend over 300 Euros for a hotel (thankfully my Mom was paying for this stay).,0
712,"At the risk of sounding like a line from ""Cabaret,"" everything about this hotel is beautiful.",0
713,The lobby is beautiful.,0
714,The restaurants are beautiful.,0
715,The rooms are beautiful.,0
716,The pool and gym are are really beautiful.,0
717,Even the breakfast is a feast for the eyes (as well as the stomach).,0
718,We ate at both restaurants.,0
719,"The Trader Vic's puts our Trader Vic's here in Emeryville to shame, both with respect to decor and food quality.",0
720,"The German restaurant, Mark Brandenburg, simply had the best German food I've ever had (and I've been to Germany about 8-9 times).",0
721,One needs to swipe ones room cards in order to access the floor rooms.,0
722,The pool/gym area is open 24 hours/day.,0
723,"As a Gold HHonors member, we received an upgraded room, which was very quiet, comfortable, and large, but had no view (windows open to an inner courtyard).",0
724,"My complaints about the hotel: (1) Charging 22 Euros/day for lousy (off/on) internet service is a bit outrageous given the very high room charges, (2) Temperature difficult to adjust in the room (no thermostat),",0
725,"and we couldn't get it quite cool enough for comfort, (3) Rather thin towels for a luxury hotel, (4) Needless step to the beds; great for tripping on (especially for an older person such as my mother).",0
726,"So a very nice hotel, albeit not a great value.",0
727,I would go here if money were of no object (and not otherwise).,0
728,"We stayed at Hilton Berlin in early June, 2006.",0
729,"We are Diamond HHonor memebers,",0
730,so were upgraded to executive room on the executive floor.,0
731,"The room is average looking, with motel style bedspread and decrative pillows.",0
732,"underneath the bedspread, there are 2 twin comforters, which is wierd for a queen room.",0
733,"Bathroom is average looking too, with mold smell.",0
734,concierge not helpful and very unfriendly.,0
735,executive floor representitives are cold too.,0
736,"we stayed at many hiltons worldwide,",0
737,"we feel this is a below average hilton, especially for it's service.",0
738,we defintely will try other hotels when we return to berlin next time.,0
739,They also have a nice pool and spa,0
740,"but the children at all hours in the pool will drive you to the nudist spa area, which is pretty nice and child free.",0
741,There are several good restaurants near by.,0
742,We loved the eastern sector location with it's delightful walking areas and proximity to museum island and gorgeous neo-classical architecture.,0
743,The Potsdammer Platz is very times square with it's glass and steel highrises and heavy traffic.,0
744,The rooms are very comfortable - typical Hilton decor - nice sheets and good showers.,0
745,The concierge was very helpful with local restaurants.,0
746,"The lounge had a great breakfast and offered drinks through the day including wine, etc. at evenings with appetizers.",0
747,"Room _ê£_ Room was OK,",0
748,"we had a corner suite so we had plenty of room,",0
749,and bathroom was typical smallish hotel fare.,0
750,"Food _ê£_ Breakfast _ê£_ Only had breakfast on the last day _ê£_ good spread, fresh and presented well.",0
751,"Dinner at Trader Vics _ê£_ Again OK, it was nothing to write home about.",0
752,We had much better meals at the surrounding cafes/restaurants.,0
753,"Staff _ê£_ Reception desk staff were fine,",0
754,"the concierge that we went to see about finding a laundry mat was a bit of pain in the rear,",0
755,"he sent us to the right suburb but the wrong street,",0
756,it was around the corner and across the road.,0
757,Overall _ê£_ This is a typical businessman_ê£_s / conference hotel.,0
758,its location was it_ê£_s main attraction to us.,0
759,Stayed at the 5 Star Hilton Berlin for two nights to experience the Christmas Markets and celebrate my friends birthday.,0
760,We we allocated room 5088 which looked over an internal courtyard so very quiet but no view.,0
761,Most importantly the room appeared clean and well maintained.,0
762,The size of the room was adequate,0
763,but the luxurious touches I would have expected from a hotel of this standard were in my opinion poor.,0
764,"There were robes (not very large, soft or fluffy) and slippers, small, thin towels (in fact my friends had to share a towel).",0
765,King size bed (plus added squeaky springs) with two single duvets.,0
766,Minimal tea  coffee (one cup per day) and mini bar.,0
767,The room also had ironing facilites.,0
768,There was a pool and spa,0
769,but I don't have experience them.,0
770,With last minute it was room only so no idea what the breakfast was like.,0
771,The redeeming point was the hotel's location which was superb.,0
772,"Hotel is well-situated near main attractions, restaurants and shopping.",0
773,"Room was clean, well furnished and serviced promptly.",0
774,The room air conditioning had a hard time keeping up with the warm temperatures in Berlin.,0
775,The restaurant (Mark Brandenburg) was over-priced and had marginal food.,0
776,The hotel was overrun with meetings and groups.,0
777,"There was an unexplained,",0
778,additional Hotel charge of 8 Euros that appeared on my credit card statement.,0
779,"I challenged the charge in an e-mail to the hotel, and followed up with e-mails to the Hotel (twice), HiltonHonors and Hilton corporate.",0
780,None of these Hilton entities have had the courtesy of even responding (no less reversing this charge) in over a week.,0
781,"Stayed in a standard room - clean,quiet and very comfortable.",0
782,Hotel amenities were excellent.,0
783,Staff very friendly.,0
784,Restaurants - food great and a nice selection.,0
785,It is in a very good location - tube stop right outside or walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie.,0
786,A great choice!!,0
787,Stayed here for four nights.,0
788,We upgraded to a room with a view of the Gendarmenmarkt for 20 euros a night.,0
789,The room is avarage in size.,0
790,Double bed quite narrow and not as comfortable as expected.,0
791,Bathroom nice but on the small size.,0
792,"Breakfast was included in our deal,",0
793,yet each morning they asked for our signature as on their records it appeard as if our breakfast was exclusive.,0
794,I would have assumed that after their first mistake they'll sort their records but it never happened.,0
795,Unfortunately i fell ill on our last day there.,0
796,I sent my husband to get me an Aspirin until we buy one at a pharmacy.,0
797,They couldn't spare us one and said they didn't have any.,0
798,There is no turndown service as well.,0
799,"Apart from all the above the location is great, central and quite.",0
800,and our last stop was Berlin.,0
801,Very very unfortunate for us that Park Inn was fully booked,0
802,and the tour agent booked this hotel.,0
803,No cafes or shops within safe walking distance.,0
804,"The hotel is in a very good location, close to the train station and other city attractions.",0
805,The rooms were great,0
806,but I would have spent a lot of time in it to make up for the deficiencies of this place.,0
807,"The swimming pool is rather small, just enough to refresh yourself.",0
808,"All in all a OK hotel, but not nice and cosy.",0
